### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Revert is a unified API for all your customer facing integrations, starting with CRMs such as Salesforce, Hubspot, Pipedrive.

This means you do not need to integrate with multiple third-party APIs yourself and only integrate with Revert once. New third party integrations will automatically be added and can be turned on immediately.
Your customers authenticate their CRMs with us using our drop-in UI that you can integrate in your front-end.

We're constantly adding new endpoints and support for new CRMs so be in the lookout of the APIs updating often.
